# Chainlink CRE Hackathon — Tracks, Prizes, Requirements (Updated)

## Event
- **Name:** Convergence: A Chainlink Hackathon
- **Dates:** Feb 6 – Mar 1
- **Core requirement:** Use a CRE Workflow as an orchestration layer that integrates at least one blockchain with an external API/system/data source/LLM/AI agent, and show a successful simulation via CRE CLI or a live CRE deployment.

## Prize Tracks (Main)
### DeFi & Tokenization — **$20,000**
- 1st: **$12,000**

### CRE & AI — **$17,000**
- 1st: **$10,500**
- 2nd: **$6,500**
- Examples: AI agents consuming CRE workflows with x402 payments, AI‑assisted CRE workflows.

### Prediction Markets — **$16,000**
- 1st: **$10,000**
- 2nd: **$6,000**
- Focus: decentralized prediction/forecasting apps with verifiable market resolution.

### Risk & Compliance — **$16,000**
- 1st: **$10,000**
- 2nd: **$6,000**
- Focus: monitoring, safeguards, automated controls, reserve health checks.

### Privacy — **$16,000**
- 1st: **$10,000**

### Top 10 Projects — **$15,000 total**
- **$1,500 x 10** for runner‑up projects using CRE.

## Additional Partner / Special Tracks

## Submission Requirements (apply broadly)
- Build/simulate/deploy a CRE workflow that integrates onchain + external data/AI.
- **3–5 minute public demo video** showing workflow execution or CLI simulation.
- **Public source repo** (e.g., GitHub).
- **README** linking all files that use Chainlink.
- Past projects are not accepted unless updated with new components.

## Track Fit for This Project
**Project:** Prediction‑Informed Router for Uniswap v4

**Qualifies for CRE?** Yes — if a CRE workflow fetches external prediction data and writes an onchain risk signal used by the router/hook.

**Best‑fit track:**
- **Prediction Markets** (primary)

**Also applicable (optional):**
- **Risk & Compliance** (risk tiering, safeguards)
- **CRE & AI** (only if using agents/LLMs for signal classification)
